# Renee Salem | Data Analyst 

Data Analyst with a Bachelor's Degree in Mass Communication and Advertising. I recently graduated from a Data Analytics program at Michigan State University, where I furthered my web development skills and added Python, Pandas, Machine Learning, and more to my skillset. With my minors in Sociology and Theatre and my retail experience, I have learned that data and data collection is not limited to the computer. This has improved my understanding of how consumers think and their multiple perspectives. 

Extensive organizational skills and time spent working alone, and with a team. Recently enrolled in University of Denverâ€™s Frontline Manager Leadership Program. I am excited to bring these skills and background to any team.
